  Tclkit is a standalone application combining Tcl, Tk, TclVfs, IncrTcl, and
  Metakit.  It runs on a wide range of platforms and supports starkits.

  For detailed information about Tclkit and starkits, visit:

  Tclkit comes in two flavors: one is for command-line use, the other has a GUI.
  On Windows these two are called TCLKITSH.EXE and TCLKIT.EXE, respectively,
  but on Unix, a single "tclkit" handles both cases (Tk is loaded on request).

  On the classic Mac, you'll need Metrowerks Codewarrior.  See the mac/ subdir.
  Mac OS X using X11 now builds with genkit.  Mac Aqua is work in progress.

  See http://www.equi4.com/pub/tk/ for a big collection of pre-built binaries.
